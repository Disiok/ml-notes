# Statistical Modeling in Machine Learning

I think before I had this misconception of modeling = math.
But really, modeling comes down to formulating a set of assumptions about a specific problem you are trying to solve.

It's often hard to disentangle the various related studies as they are intricately linked. But the core focus of them is subtly different:  
* Statistical modeling: make some assumption about the probablistic distribution of observed data to make statistical conclusions
* Machine learning modeling: Make simplying assumptions about observed "patterns" and use an algorithmic approach to learn them. Often underpinned by a statistical model, but not always
* Computer vision modeling: understand the geometry of the world, how light works, etc.

SVM is a class of models that was not necessarily motivated by a statistical interpretation. A quick search on Google shows the following question/answer:
